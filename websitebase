data processing big data technologies stacks in iceberg on hdfs and iceberg on minio
Based on your business requirements and long-term technology strategy, we recommend evaluating both Iceberg on HDFS and Iceberg on MinIO for the Client Team Data Lakehouse.
Iceberg on HDFS is best suited for organizations with an existing, mature Hadoop ecosystem, stable batch-heavy workloads, and in-house Hadoop expertise where infrastructure is already sunk cost.
However, for most modern analytics, streaming, and scalable use cases, Iceberg on MinIO provides a more cloud-native, cost-efficient, and operationally simpler architecture, significantly reducing DevOps effort, infrastructure overhead, and long-term operational risk.
